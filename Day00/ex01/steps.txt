 - creating a file called testDay00
 touch testDay00

 - checking the details of the file
 ls -l

 - the file contains a 40 bytes content, so I filled up with 40 random characters
 vim testDay00

 - the file has r permissions for the user, rx for the group and rx for the others
 chmod u=r,g=rx,o=rx testDay00

 - now the file looks like the one presented in the exercise
 tar -cf testDay00.tar testDay00

 git add .
 git commit -m "ex00 commited together with its steps"
 git config --global credential.helper store
 git push
